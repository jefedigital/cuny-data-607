# Week Five - Working with Tidy Data [20-Sep 26-Sep]

  ### Week 5 Overview

  This week, we'll look at how to use R to tidy (reshape) our data, moving between "wide" and "long" formats to best support our analysis.  We'll work with tidy data using both "base R" functionality and Hadley Wickham's **tidyr** package.  We also introduce Hadley's **dplyr** package.  You'll practice using both of these packages in your Week 5 assignment, and in your Project 2, due next week.

  ### Week 5 Core Reading

  **Please read:**

  - *R for Data Science*, chapters on [Data Transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), [Tidy Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), and [Relational Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).
  - [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) by Hadley Wickham. This is often cited as one of the most important papers on data science! You may also find helpful the [tidyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), which Hadley Wickham describes as "an informal and code heavy version of the full tidy data paper."
  - *Data Science for Business*, chapter 5.

  ***Additional Practice (optional)***

  Here are two DataCamp courses and one project related to this week's material:

  - [Data Manipulation with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-dplyr)
  - [Cleaning Data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-dplyr)
  - [Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/74)

  ### [Discussion 5: Untidy Data](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525177_1&mode=view)

  Find (or create) an example of an untidy dataset—for example, a “wide” table of descriptive data taken from an HTML page. You should also describe some kind of analysis that might be performed on the data. You should not tidy, transform, or analyze the data here, since that will be one part of your Project 2 deliverable (which is also available in your week 5 folder!). Please see my sample post, which is taken from your Week 5 assignment.

  *
  Please make your post before end of day on Wednesday.  Please also respond to any of your classmates' questions about your post.*

  You may work in a small group on this assignment.

  We’ll look at some of the most interesting student solutions during our meetup next Wednesday.
