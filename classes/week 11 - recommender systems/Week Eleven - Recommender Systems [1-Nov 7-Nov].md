# Week Eleven - Recommender Systems [1-Nov 7-Nov]

 

- ### Overview

  This week, we'll introduce recommender systems, which are arguably the most important current "commercialization" of data science!

  Your discussion and assignment are combined into a single item this week.  You're not expected to write any code in your analysis. But since this is a combined discussion/assignment, you should treat this as a more indepth discussion. You should include at least one citatio

  Also, your final project is available, and your final project proposal is due next Thursday.  This proposal should convey your first thoughts about your project's goals and data sources.  Your proposal should also be posted as a discussion item.  You won't be locked in--you may change direction as you get deeper into your work.  I'll schedule short one-on-one discussions with each person or team over the next two weeks to learn more about your final projects!

- ### Reading

  Please read:

  - *Data Science for Business*, Chapter 11.



- ### Supplementary Material

  Here are some good resources to learn more about Recommender Systems:

  - Chapters 2 and 3 of *A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining*, which is freely available [here](http://www.guidetodatamining.com/). The code examples are in Python
  - A somewhat different presentation of the same material can be found in *Mining Massive Data Sets,* chapter 9: “Recommender Systems,” freely downloadable [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch9.pdf  ). 
  - For students who want to build out an R-based Recommender System, the [recommenderlab](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recommenderlab/vignettes/recommenderlab.pdf) package provides excellent support.  Implementing a basic recommender could be an excellent final project!

  Your task is to analyze an existing recommender system that you find interesting.  You should:

  1. Perform a Scenario Design analysis as described below.  Consider whether it makes sense for your selected recommender system to perform scenario design twice, once for the organization (e.g. Amazon.com) and once for the organization's customers.
  2. Attempt to reverse engineer what you can about the site, from the site interface and any available information that you can find on the Internet or elsewhere.
  3. Include specific recommendations about how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward. 
  4. Create your report using an R Markdown file, and create a discussion thread with a link to the GitHub repo where your Markdown file notebook resides.  You are not expected to need to write code for this discussion assignment.

  Here are two examples of the kinds of papers that might be helpful backgrounders for your research in #2 above (if you had chosen amazon.com or nytimes.com as your web site):

  - *IEEE Internet Computing*, Greg Linden, Brent Smith, and Jeremy York (2003): [Amazon.com Recommendations:  Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Amazon].pdf).
  - Alex Spangher (2015): [Building the Next New York Times Recommendation Engine](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/). 

  

  **How to Perform a Scenario Analysis (review)**

  Scenario Design is an easy-to-use “three question framework” that helps you in making sure that the information in your analysis work takes UX (user experience) into account:

  Source: “Scenario Design:  A Disciplined Approach to Customer Experience,” Bruce D. Temkin, Forrester Research, 2004.  Temkin notes that before applying Scenario Design, one might ask, “What functionality should we offer?”  After applying Scenario Design, one might instead ask, “What user goals should we serve?”

  Your task is to:

  1. Identify a recommender system web site, then
  2. Answer the three scenario design questions for this web site.  

  This process of guessing/reverse engineering, while inexact, will help you build out your own ability to better account for “user needs” in designing recommender systems going forward.  Being able to place the customer first in your mind is a “soft skill” that is highly valued in the technical marketplace.

  *You may work in a small group on this discussion assignment!  Please make your initial draft post (which includes a link to your GitHub hosted R Markdown file before our meetup on Wednesday, and provide your final post and feedback to at least one of your class mates’ posts before end of day on Sunday.  Your feedback should include at least one additional reference and/or constructive suggestion.*



- ### Final Project Proposals

  *You are encouraged to read each others' proposals, weigh in, suggest data sources and "avenues of attack," question assumptions, etc.* 

  
  Please start by carefully reading through the requirements in the “MSDA 607 Final Project” document, which can be found in this folder.

  
  Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis.  You should describe where you believe you'll find your source data.  One paragraph of text that addresses these issues will be sufficient.  

  
  If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names. We’ll treat this as a planning document, not a blue print containing “firm, fixed requirements.” 

  
  The week after proposals are due, I’ll schedule short meetings with each person (or group) to go through your data sources, plan for doing the work, concerns, etc. I’d encourage you to sketch out these thoughts in your proposal as well, but it is not required in your proposal deliverable.


  Your final project proposal can be short:  a well-thought out paragraph may be sufficient.
