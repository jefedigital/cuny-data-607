  ### Week 3 Core Reading

  

  Please read:

  - ***R for Data Science\*, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ chapter 14, 15, 16**
  - *Automated Data Collection with R*, ch 7
  - *FES*, [http://www.feat.engineering/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), ch 4

  The R for Data Science readings are core. The other reading assignments this week are optional. There will be occasional, extra-credit quizzes on the optional reading assignments.

  Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful.

  ### [Discussion 3: Analyzing sets of text/log files](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525190_1&mode=view)

  For this week’s data science context discussion,  you’re asked to identify (or imagine) a “use case” that involves “loading a set of text files, and then performing an analysis on the loaded, combined dataset.” 

  
  A short description of your use case is sufficient.  Here is an example: 

  
  “Each day, my organization’s primary database creates a log file with about 50 MB of activity information. I would create an automated process to load the log files generated by my database server, and generate a daily report that tells me what are the five most frequently run queries and five slowest running queries for the previous day, and I would track how these frequent and/or slow queries change over time. This would help me to prioritize my database performance tuning efforts, such as deciding when to add an index to a specific table." 

  
  *Please post by end of day on Wednesday, and weigh in on at least one class mate’s post by end of day on Sunday.*

  ### Hands-On Lab: Character Manipulation and Date Processing

  Attached Files:

  This ungraded hands on lab helps you build to your skills writing R code to find the patterns in strings, extract character matching and process different date formats. Solutions to all problems are immediately available, but you’ll learn the material more durably if you attempt each problem before consulting its solution.

  \1. Create a vector of strings and identify strings that match a particular criteria

  \2. Replace instances of a string with another of your choosing

  \3. Identify positions of a string of interest

  \4. Use separators to combine strings with other characters or numbers

  \5. Use collapse to combine multiple string outputs together

  \6. Change the case of strings

  \7. Convert date between different formats

  \8. Identify how long ago dates occurred

  ### [Week 3 assignment](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_59525192_1&course_id=_2010109_1&group_id=&mode=view)

  *Please deliver links to an R Markdown file (in GitHub and rpubs.com) with solutions to the problems below. You may work in a small group, but please submit separately with names of all group participants in your submission.*

  \#1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.com’s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"

  \#2 Write code that transforms the data below:

  [1] "bell pepper" "bilberry"   "blackberry"  "blood orange"

  [5] "blueberry"  "cantaloupe"  "chili pepper" "cloudberry" 

  [9] "elderberry"  "lime"     "lychee"    "mulberry"  

  [13] "olive"    "salal berry"

  Into a format like this:

  c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")

  The two exercises below are taken from *R for Data Science*, 14.3.5.1 in the on-line version:

  \#3 Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

  - (.)\1\1
  - "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
  - (..)\1
  - "(.).\\1.\\1"
  - "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"

  \#4 Construct regular expressions to match words that:

  - Start and end with the same character.
  - Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
  - Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)
