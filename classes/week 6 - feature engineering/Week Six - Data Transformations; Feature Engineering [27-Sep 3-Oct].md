  ### Week 6 Overview

  This week, we focus on project 2, where we practice using the R packages **tidyr** and **dplyr** to prepare three different datasets for downstream analysis.

  Please continue to monitor (and contribute to!) the Week 5 Discussion forum on tidying and transforming data.  Your classmates that have chosen your sample dataset may have additional questions for you related to the data or analysis.

  ### Optional: Hadley Wickham on the Tidyverse

  Here is Hadley Wickham's 1 hour [keynote presentation](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/data-science-in-the-tidyverse-hadley-wickham/) from the inaugural RStudio conference in Orlando, January 2017:

  ### [Discussion 6: Data Insights into Soft Skills](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525170_1&mode=view)

  In our upcoming third project, you will be asked to collaborate in a group. While our MS in Data Sciene program focuses on building the technical skills for a data scientist, soft skills like the ability to collaborate virtually are necessary for success in our field. 

  First, please read this article on Google’s data-driven search for insights on building high functioning teams:

  Duhigg, Charles (2016): [What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html).

  In this week’s discussion, you’re asked to find, discuss and cite another reference that shows how data can be used to provide insights to improving collaboration or another “soft skill” that is relevant to data scientists.

  Please make your initial post by end of day on Wednesday, and respond to at least one classmate's post by end of day on Sunday.
