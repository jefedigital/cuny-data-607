- ### Web APIs: Core Learning Materials

  Please do the following:

  **Read**:

  - Automated Data Collection with R, chapter 9.
  - Data Science for Business, chapter 9.

  **Watch**:

  RStudio's Garrett Grolemund's RStudio demonstrates how to use HTTP, httr, and jsonlite in [Extracting data from the web: Part 1-httr](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/extracting-data-from-the-web-part-1/).

  Grolemund provides the slides and code [here](https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/tree/master/31-Web-APIs).

  The three parts of an HTTP response object. When working with web APIs that return json, sometimes a combination of httr and jsonlite is easiest.

- ### [Discussion 9: Scenario Design](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525138_1&mode=view)

  Scenario Design is an easy-to-use “three question framework” that helps you in making sure that the information in your analysis work takes UX (user experience) into account:

  Source: “Scenario Design:  A Disciplined Approach to Customer Experience,” Bruce D. Temkin, Forrester Research, 2004.  Temkin notes that before applying Scenario Design, one might ask, “What functionality should we offer?”  After applying Scenario Design, one might instead ask, “What user goals should we serve?”

  Your task is to:

  1. Identify an informational web site such as an infographic (providing the URL), then
  2. Answer the three scenario design questions for this web site.  

  This process of guessing/reverse engineering, while inexact, will help you build out your own ability to better account for “user needs” in designing analyses, reports and web sites (or any product design initiative!) going forward.  Being able to place the customer first in your mind is a “soft skill” that is highly valued in the technical marketplace.

  *Please make your initial post no later than Wednesday, and provide feedback to at least one of your class mates’ posts before end of day on Sunday.*
