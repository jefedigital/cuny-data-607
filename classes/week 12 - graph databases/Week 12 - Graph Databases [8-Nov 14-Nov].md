# Week 12 - Graph Databases [8-Nov 14-Nov]

 

## 

- ### Overview

  This week, we'll introduce graph databases, and learn about using Neo4j, which is currently [the most popular Graph DBMS](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms).  Data Scientists work with graphs both in social network analysis, and in logistical work, such as optimizing transportation networks.

- ### Week 12 Reading

  Please read Data Science for Business, chapter 12.

- ### [Neo4j (optional)](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/displayLearningUnit?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525102_1)

  The videos, links to resources, and hands on labs in this module will walk you through the basic steps of installing and starting Neo4j, managing multiple databases, and loading data.

  

  - Here is Neo4j's [Getting Started page](http://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/)
  - Take a look at this free, [on-line tutorial on Neo4j and Graph databases](http://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-course/)
  - Here are some [tutorials](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/tutorials.html) that you may find helpful
  - Here are some specific [instructions for loading data from a PostgreSQL database into Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/developer/guide-importing-data-and-etl/)
  - Here is an example of how graph databases are being used:

  - Steven Mellendez (2016): [NASA is Harnessing Graph Databases to Organize Lessons Learned from Past Projects ](https://www.fastcompany.com/3065044/mind-and-machine/nasa-is-harnessing-graph-databases-to-organize-lessons-learned-from-past-pr)
  - This O'Reilly book, [Graph Databases](http://info.neotechnology.com/rs/neotechnology/images/GraphDatabases.pdf), has been made freely downloadable.

- ### Graph Theory

  Students with either a background in mathematics or who have taken a discrete math course in a computer science curriculum will have already done some work with network analysis, graph theory and graph algorithms.

  To get an overview (or a refresher), the Khan academy material on Graph Representation and Breadth-first search provide a good starting point:

  - Khan Academy: [Graph Representation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms#graph-representation) 
  - Khan Academy: [Breadth-first search](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms#breadth-first-search)

  

- ### iGraph

  Instead of using Neo4j, you can use an R package like iGraph to model your graph data.  The attached presentation slide deck, dataset, and code, and the recorded, related Office Hours from a previous semester provide some initial guidance on using iGraph.

- ### [Discussion 12: Network Analysis and Fraud Detection](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525104_1&mode=view)

  First, please watch this presentation:

  [![img](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6H5Lp3i05Cg/1.jpg)Watch Video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H5Lp3i05Cg)

  Mini Lecture: Social Network Analysis for Fraud Detection

  **Duration:** 33:52 
  **User:** n/a - **Added:** 11/25/13

  **YouTube URL:** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H5Lp3i05Cg


  Next, describe an example of how network analytics is being used (or could be used) to detect fraud (or another undesirable activity.)

- ### [Final Project Proposals](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_2010109_1&content_id=_59525105_1&mode=view)

  *You are encouraged to read each others' proposals, weigh in, suggest data sources and "avenues of attack," question assumptions, etc.*

  Please start by carefully reading through the requirements in the “MSDA 607 Final Project” document, which can be found in your Week 11 folder.

  Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis.  You should describe where you believe you'll find your source data.  One paragraph of text that addresses these issues will be sufficient.  

  If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names. We’ll treat this as a planning document, not a blue print containing “firm, fixed requirements.” 

  The week after proposals are due, I’ll schedule short meetings with each person (or group) to go through your data sources, plan for doing the work, concerns, etc. I’d encourage you to sketch out these thoughts in your proposal as well, but it is not required in your proposal deliverable.

  Your final project proposal can be short:  a well-thought out paragraph may be sufficient.

  ### Project 4

  Project 4 is due end of day on Saturday.  You'll find the Project 4 requirements and submission link in "Major Assignments".
